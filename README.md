Setup:
-Ensure you have psycopg2 installed (if not, install using "pip install psycopg2")

-Modify the database.ini contents to match that of your Postgresql database information

The information used should be the same that's prompted by PSQL, and use the name of the desired database to connect to.

-To run the program, run "python main.py" when in the program directory.
